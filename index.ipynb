    "In this lab, we will build a basic version of low-rank matrix factorization engine for recommending movies in using Numpy and SciPy. The purpose of this lesson to help develop a sound understanding of how this process works in detail, before we implement it in PySpark. We will use a small movie recommendation dataset suitable for such experiments. The system should make not highly accurate, yet meaningful recommendations. \n",

    "In this lab, we learned that we can make good recommendations with collaborative filtering methods using latent features from low-rank matrix factorization methods. This technique also scales significantly better to larger datasets. We will next work with a larger MovieLense dataset and using the mapreduce techniques seen in the previous section, we will use PySpark to implement a similar approach using an implementation of matrix factorization called Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method.
